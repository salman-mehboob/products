# Simple Product API

## What is it?

This is a simple API written in Java Spring Boot which reads several products from a file and then returns them as a
JSON response.

## What should I do?

Candidates start by creating their own branch off of "main". They can then enhance the API by implementing the below
business requirements. Finally, once satisfied a merge request should be raised and assigned to "Kyle Parry" for review.

1. Add a resource to save a new product.
   1. It should not be possible to insert a product with an existing ID.
2. Add a resource to query/filter products by id.
3. Add a resource to query/filter products by type.
4. Add a resource to remove a specific product.
5. Add request validation to all resources.

## Tips

- Think about how you go about testing your application.
